# 🛠️ shell-toolbox

A **minimal, zero-to-productive Z shell setup** powered by Oh My Zsh.  
It gives you a clean prompt, a couple of sensible plugins, and a small
collection of PATH tweaks & aliases—nothing more, nothing less.

## 📋 Prerequisites


- **Zsh**
- **Oh My Zsh**
- **Homebrew**


## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
./install.zsh
```

*The script backs up an existing `~/.zshrc` to `~/.zshrc.bak.<timestamp>`  
before copying the repo’s `zshrc` in its place and reloading your shell.*
